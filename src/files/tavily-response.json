As a self-proclaimed coffee connoisseur, I've had my fair share of cups in the city. Whether you're searching for a place to sit down and catch up with a friend or looking to taste the best third-wave coffee the city has to offer, there's something for everyone on this list of the best coffee shops in San Francisco.\n\n## **Andytown Coffee Roasters**\n\nThere's always a lineup at this cozy, contemporary coffee shop in the Outer Sunset. And for good reason! Known best for the famous Snowy Plover, a refreshing coffee float made with espresso, Pellegrino and the most delicious homemade whipped cream I've ever tasted!\n\n## **Blue Bottle Coffee**\n\nWith a focus on single origin beans, Blue Bottle Coffee is considered one of the most knowledgable and skillful coffee roasters in the third wave coffee game. With cafes in LA, SF, NYC, & Japan, their fresh and flavorful roasts are carefully sourced and treated with care to produce a premium product. My favorite Blue Bottle location to visit is the one inside the San Francisco Ferry Building! *Hot Tip: Order a Liege waffle and enjoy your coffee with a gorgeous view of the Bay Bridge - you can't go wrong!*\n\n## **Cafe Réveille**\n\nCafe Réveille started out as a single Coffee Truck in Jackson Square, now with multiple cafes across the Bay Area. Their Mission Bay location offers a charming spot to sit down and enjoy your coffee outdoors on one of their pretty pink table tops! Their brunch menu is delicious AF and rotates occasionally.\n\n## **Flywheel Coffee Roasters**\n\nLocated in Haight-Ashbury, Flywheel is hands-down one of the best coffee shops in San Francisco. An independent specialty coffee roaster, they offer a variety of hand crafted methods including siphon, cold brew and nitro to name a few. The baristas are friendly and the espresso drinks are fantastic. Grab a seat by the window and soak in the sunlight as you sip on your coffee in the industrial-style space.\n\n## **Four Barrel Coffee**\n\nIf I *had* to pick a favorite on this list - Four Barrel would be it. An independent, locally owned coffee roastery in The Mission, where the beans (which come from third-generation farmers and mill-workers in Latin America, Indonesia, and East Africa) are roasted fresh in-house. If you want to see the roasting process in action, just grab a seat at the back bar and watch them work their magic! Giving each cup the attention it deserves, you'll find that Four Barrel's baristas are friendly, efficient and consistent. The espresso is always smooth, indicating a carefully extracted espresso shot, and the latte art is well-executed. It’s the smoothest cup you’ll find in the Bay Area (IMHO) and it's easy to come often and stay awhile. Read more about Four Barrel [here](https://www.sugarandstamps.com/blog/four-barrel-coffee). ***PS:*** *You can also find Four Barrel Coffee served at San Francisco favorites like Dynamo Donut or The Mill to enjoy alongside some tasty pastries!*\n\n## **Hollow (Temporarily Closed)**\n\nThis hidden gem has a beautiful outdoor space where you can sip their delicious, gourmet coffee. Located in Inner Sunset, I discovered this spot while strolling around the neighborhood (post-Dynamo Donut) and enjoyed my time at this cozy cafe.\n\n## **Home Cafe**\n\nIf you're looking for the most unique and flavorful lattes in San Francisco, look no further than Home Cafe. This spot is perfect place to start off your weekend. Where else can you get such an assortment of lattes and creative toast options?! Though I much prefer my coffee without any added sugar, I love treating myself to their famous birthday cake latte, even when it’s not my birthday!\n\n## **LINEA CAFFE**\n\nThis cute little corner caffe & eco-friendly espresso bar is located in The Mission and quickly became a favorite of mine. The espresso is smooth as can be and their almond milk is steamed to perfection. I’ve been back many times and they never disappoint! Bonus points for the silky-smooth ceramic cups that give you a pop of red for your #coffeegram!\n\n## **marigold cafe**\n\nOne of the newest spots on the map in San Francisco, Marigold is a beautiful cafe & flower shop concept. Their coffee shop is tucked behind Marigold’s flower shop on a quiet street in The Mission. Warm tones and floral bouquets adorn the space, where they serve Heart Roasters (one of my favorites from Portland), delicious seasonal drinks & a small selection of pastries. Outdoor seating is also available, perfect for catching up with a friend or reading a good book!\n\n## **Philz Coffee**\n\nWith multiple locations across San Francisco, my go-to spot for a morning pour over is none other than Philz! Focusing on made-to-order drip coffee, this place has had my heart for a long long time. Not sure what to order? Don't worry — the baristas here are top notch. Briefly describe how you like your coffee and they’ll get you going in the right direction. **My bean preferences:** Tesora, Silken Soul (a blend of Silken Splendor & Philtered Soul), and the Mission Cold Brew!\n\n## **Ritual Coffee Roasters**\n\nA top contender in San Francisco's third wave coffee scene is Ritual. Ritual is a fully independent and woman-owned coffee roasting company, maintaining the highest standard for quality and sustainable sourcing in the industry. The flagship cafe on Valencia Street first opened in 2005, and Ritual now has cafes throughout the city as well as in Napa and the Harvey Milk Terminal (1B) at SFO Airport. Consistently flavorful and aromatic coffee is what you can expect here. Learn more about Ritual [here](https://www.sugarandstamps.com/blog/ritual-coffee-roasters).\n\n## **Saint Frank Coffee**\n\nThis swanky coffee shop nestled in Russian Hill serves quality beans in a simple and serene environment. Minimalist decor and an airy atmosphere make for a perfect space to come get some work done and sip on your coffee of choice! **PS:** Whether or not you like to opt for non-dairy, they've got a fantastic almond & macadamia nut milk that you *must* try!\n\n## **Sightglass Coffee**\n\nIt's not just the beautiful, two-level industrial space that brings all the San Franciscans to Sightglass - the stellar coffee quality (all light roasts, BTW) is enough to keep you coming back time after time. Spend a few hours in this pretty space filled with sunlight and wooden accents, and don't forget to try something from their affogato bar at the 7th Street flagship location!\n\n## **The COFFEE MOVEMENT**\n\nI stumbled upon this place on a staycation in San Francisco and I’m so glad I did! Serving up great craft coffee in a cozy, well-lit space in Chinatown / Nob Hill near the Cable Car line, the gentlemen running this place are not only super friendly but also really know their stuff! Minimalist vibes, a warm interior and great dairy alternative options.\n\n## **Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters**\n\nArguably one of the best and most historic cups of coffee in the Bay Area, Wrecking Ball is serving up specialty coffee that is sustainably sourced and roasted by experts in their field. And the ever so popular pineapple wallpaper doesn't hurt either! *While you’re here, grab a photo for the gram.*\n\n## *Did I leave out your favorite place to grab a cup?* *Tell me in the comments below!*\n\n[COFFEE](/blog/category/COFFEE), [GUIDES](/blog/category/GUIDES), [SAN FRANCISCO](/blog/category/SAN+FRANCISCO), [USA](/blog/category/USA), [CALIFORNIA](/blog/category/CALIFORNIA), [LIFESTYLE](/blog/category/LIFESTYLE), [SAN FRANCISCO FOOD](/blog/category/SAN+FRANCISCO+FOOD)[Sugar & Stamps](/blog?author=56e8fcbe8a65e2ee7d9c87fa)[SAN FRANCISCO](/blog/tag/SAN+FRANCISCO), [COFFEE SHOP](/blog/tag/COFFEE+SHOP), [COFFEE TALK](/blog/tag/COFFEE+TALK), [SF COFFEE](/blog/tag/SF+COFFEE), [BEST COFFEE SF](/blog/tag/BEST+COFFEE+SF)[5 Comments](/blog/best-coffee-shops-in-san-francisco#comments-5885043e37c581fc6ae2bc60)\n\n[Facebook0](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sugarandstamps.com%2Fblog%2Fbest-coffee-shops-in-san-francisco)  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sugarandstamps.com%2Fblog%2Fbest-coffee-shops-in-san-francisco&text=There+is+no+shortage+of+phenomenal+coffee+shops+in+the+San+Francisco+Bay+Area.+As+a+coffee+connoisseur%2C+...)

And we're starting with a now iconic Blue \nBottle coffee. A quintessential San Francisco success story that evolved from a humble coffee \ncart in 2002 to now extremely popular specialty coffee chain with more than 70 locations across \nthe United States and even in Japan my preferred spot is the Sansome Street one. Not only does it \noffer an excellent environment for work but its interior design is also a visual delight. Just take a look at this space. While I was enjoying my scone as much as I did last year I felt that the coffee \nquality had declined a little. Kind of lacking the previous subtlety but maybe it's just my personal \npreference. They also offer a few snacks but it's not the place where you can have a full meal. \nGood news is our next place might be just the perfect spot if this is what you're looking for. We have another blue in the name but this one comes from overseas. Bluestone Lane started as a small Australian-inspired cafe and it has grown into a very popular chain with locations across the \ncountry. While it's known for its coffee Bluestone  Lane also offers a really good selection for lunch \nthe Folsom Street location is one of my favorites with its clean and open design the coffee wasn't \nthe best to my taste but what I definitely recommend it for is the space and the\nfood. The next on the list is Andytown's downtown location. This coffee shop is located right at \nthe Salesforce Park and it has really beautiful views from the window. It can get busy but if you \nmanage to snag a table by the window it's one of the best places for a work session Next up is Equator's Coffee's downtown location it's next in the lobby of the Lincoln and this spot offers \na very open bright space with plenty of tables and surprisingly it's quiet most of the time it's \nreally a great place if you need to focus it's such a cool big space the lot are just nice and \nour fifth place on this list is a Flywheel Roers also located in downtown this is their second \nlocation and while it's not the best spot for working on a laptop it can be a perfect one for a \nwork meeting or an interview fly also stands out for its unique brewing options like siphon coffee \nand since they're a roaster you can grab some of their beans to take home and as we're on the topic \nof beans it makes a perfect transition to the next chapter [Music] roasters so the first one is \ncalled Lineia Roers what first caught my eye was the logo almost a perfect copy of one of my \nfavorite camera brands Leica and you can see the roasting room from the inside when you're grabbing \nyour coffee they offer great selection of beans the space inside is quite limited so it's mostly \na to- go place or the place where you can buy some beans next up is Sexant Coffee which has two \nlocations we visited the one in the mission and it's a beautiful space with a design I really \nlove so we came here to grab beans for home but we couldn't resist of taking a takeaway cup as well \nthe barista was really helpful in recommending the beans which is always a plus so if you're looking \nfor a nice coffee spot for work there also happens to be a great place to buy beans check out the \nSexton Coffee Rosters the next one is just down the Valencia Street from the Sexton Cough and it's \ncalled Ritual Coffee Rosters while their mission location is bigger we actually prefer the one on \nOctavia Boulevard it's a small to-go cafe but the location is just next to this little square which \nmakes it perfect to enjoy your cup of coffee and also enjoy the view when we came the weather was \nperfect it was sunny and it was autumn time so the leaves were beautiful and gold you can see that \nit's a neighborhood spot because there was a lot of people with their dogs and kids playing around \nthis is definitely a place to enjoy in a good sunny day in the park with your coffee to go and \nit has this very vivid color design and it also makes a good transition to our next chapter \nwhere we're going to explore the shops with beautiful design the first out of three places \nis called the Ptown Coffee which I also call the Red Train Coffee it's actually a bit of a drive \nfrom San Francisco and we discovered this place a little bit by accident while we were heading \nto explore the Gray Cove beach we ordered an oat milk cappuccino and this wasn't there strong \ntoo so we just got our coffee it was a bit of a wait and the verdict is A for design C for coffee \ncus C minus for coffee but yeah it's a cool spot while it might not be a destination spot if you're \nexploring Pacifica it's definitely a worthwhile stop for the next stop we're back in San Francisco \nand this is one of the most iconic landmarks the Transame Pyramid so this coffee spot is actually \ninside of the building which was recently renovated and reop the upper floors are offices \nbut the lobby is open to the public and that's where you'll find this little hidden gem this is \nso cool since it's not very wellnown it's a great spot for work it's cozy open and has a really nice \nrelaxed feel the place was under renovation for a while and it recently reopened a museum on the \nopposite side and it's just a really nice place our third and the last spot in this chapter is \njust a short walk from the Transame Pyramid it's down one of my favorite streets in the city this \nstreet is so different it's almost European vibe charming and picturesque feels that you're \nnot even in San Francisco the coffee shop is called Post Script Coffee and has a beautiful \ndesign and it's not just coffee shop though it's also a high-end grocery store with a few \nselect items like cheeses olive oils and other specialty products they also have lunch options \nwhich is great the only downside is the sitting it's mostly bar style sitting with high stools \nwhile it's a perfect spot for great coffee and food it's probably not the place for a full \nworkday but it's good that we discovered the one in Transame Pyramid because it makes a \nperfect combo and we're finally to our last chapter my top five places for a perfect cup \nof coffee this one focuses on the absolute best spots when it comes to the taste so let's start \nwith the first one called the coffee movement this place is located next to the Cable Car Museum \nwhich is a great spot for some discoveries of historic site of San Francisco and this is also \nthe street where the iconic cable cars drive by you can enjoy the view with the perfect cup and \nwhile this place doesn't have a lot of seating inside they have this lovely terrace outside \nwhere you can enjoy your cup or you can grab it to go and explore the area nearby next number \nfour in our top five called Moaring Coffee and as soon as you walk in you understand the reference \nin the name right away they always have car on a display and one of their tables is actually a car \nturned into a seating area and in the back there is even a separate section that is reserved for \nthe club members featuring some of really unique car models while you can peek through the window \nyou can't really go inside so if you're really into cars you might want to ask the barista on \nhow to become a part of a club the space itself is stunning open bright and just all around it's \na great spot to be kicking off our top three with Paper Sun Coffee i actually stumbled upon this \nplace by chance while I was walking through the downtown and when I entered they had a tasting \nsetup in the shop and as I've learned next day the owner was just eager to have the guests try \nsome new beans and let me tell you they were like nothing I've tried before these beans had almost \na teaike flavors that were really unique they also were very accommodating and offered me to make \na latte with the bean I like the most not only it's a great place for a perfect cup of coffee \nit's also a great spot to get some work done it's in a building with this big windows that \nlets a lot of light in and creates a perfect atmosphere for a productive session plus it's \nnot too busy so you can actually focus [Music] number two on the list is Saint Friend Coffee and \nit's also a great combo of work friendly spot and the excellent coffee the Falsome Street location \nis bright spacious and beautifully designed they offer a really good selection of beans and \nI've tried their flight set which I definitely recommend this is an offer that includes four \ndifferent drinks and barista is here to explain hot filter ice filter and then you're getting \na taste of the single origin espresso and then bundi with a little bit of milk in it as top all \nof them were really delicious the only thing I've realized is I should have tried it earlier in the \nday or at least had some food with it but don't worry you can find a perfect salty fix in our next \nspot and the last but definitely not the least is my personal favorite the mill this is a place \nthat quickly became my favorite coffee spot in the city and while coffee is great the thing that \nthis place is famous for is their delicious bread and the toasts they make with it it's extremely \npopular but it's definitely for a reason it's one of our top spots on the San Francisco \nbranch list and this is a list we covered in the previous episode so if you're looking to \nknow more about the best branch places in the"

It’s the birthplace of [Wrecking Ball Coffee](https://www.wreckingballcoffee.com), where Trish Rothgeb introduced the “[waves of coffee](https://www.latimes.com/food/story/2019-10-04/third-wave-coffee-trish-rothgeb)” terminology and changed the industry forever.

Owner and founder Kevin Bohlin’s been on a spree, too, as he opened [choux](/2022/8/30/23329445/saint-frank-opening-juniper-polk) paradise [Juniper](https://www.juniper.cafe/menu) on Polk Street in 2023 and a second San Francisco [Saint Frank location](/2024/1/12/24034881/saint-frank-opening-downtown-mira-east-cut) in SoMa.

The team at this cafe is tuned into the specialty coffee world, serving East Bay [favorite](/2023/4/4/23669733/mother-tongue-opening-east-bay-coffee-bar) Mother Tongue Coffee and top-tier toast, too.

His work — and his [expansion to Valencia Street](/2024/3/15/24102109/sextant-coffee-opening-mission-district-cafe) — is considered by many to be an example of fourth wave coffee, producing communities owning the means of production.\n\n![A latte.](https://platform.sf.eater.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24647532/00b0b_hWfZwpz4neh_1200x900_d02bb6af_237a_4328_aae5_0e3f37043f2d.jpeg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&w=2400)\n![A latte.](https://platform.sf.eater.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24647532/00b0b_hWfZwpz4neh_1200x900_d02bb6af_237a_4328_aae5_0e3f37043f2d.jpeg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&w=2400)\n\n## Telescope Coffee\n\nIf you’re looking for a SoMa coffee shop with some extra oomph (namely, signature drinks that’d be tough to find elsewhere), head over to Telescope Coffee. Not only does this cute shop offer the usual suspects in coffee — espressos, flat whites, lattes, and more — but there are also non-coffee and coffee-adjacent drinks to take on if you’ve reached your caffeine limit. The seasonal latte offerings change, such as a recent honeycomb latte, but the strawberry milk is regular option and comes served in a [cute strawberry-shaped glass](https://www.instagram.com/p/DAT8bAaTpF9/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==), a stunner in both tastes and looks.\n\n![Telescope Coffee’s latte.](https://platform.sf.eater.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25896974/ut1_TsLg__1_.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C26.153597934818%2C100%2C47.692804130365&w=2400)\n![Telescope Coffee’s latte.](https://platform.sf.eater.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25896974/ut1_TsLg__1_.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C26.153597934818%2C100%2C47.692804130365&w=2400)\n\n## Abanico Coffee Roasters\n\nAbanico Coffee Roasters brought [specialty coffee drinks and freshly roasted beans](/2021/5/20/22445160/abanico-new-coffee-shop-opens-mission-san-francisco) to the Mission in 2021.

Beyond the usual roster of lattes, mochas, and pour-overs, coffee drinkers can explore options like the Cold Fashioned, which takes cold brew and mixes it with orange bitters and gum syrup, topped with a Luxardo cherry and a flamed orange twist.

The shop also serves its coffee at the Grove at Yerba Buena and keeps customers [buzzed during Ramadan](/2023/4/3/23668313/ramadan-grand-coffee-mission-district).

Many of them are in the US of course but also downunder and in Europe. After visiting Seattle and Portland four years ago and coming face to face with the incredible coffee cultures there, I was super keen to return to the US westcoast to meet San Francisco’s very best coffee roasters during a whirlwind tour of the US and Mexico.\n\n**Shortly** after landing in fog city I set out to get my first caffeine boost of the day that would keep me going for the next 8 hours while I tried to push my body to adjust to the new time zone. My first stop that day was the Blue Bottle shop on Mint Plaza where I grabbed a delicious Flat White to go, which the barista put in my awesome Joco travel mug. This place is pretty impressive to say the least. Located inside a gorgeous building with super high ceilings, Blue Bottle is a magnet for morning coffee junkies and those who appreciate a really special coffee experience. They also serve some pretty delicious looking dishes. I decided to come back again at a different time and enjoy one of their expertly prepared Siphons.\n\n**Later** that day I stumbled upon a brand new café that’s opening its doors any day now. Located on the corner of Kearny and Market street, Mazarine Coffee will most likely become the Financial District’s new hotspot for really awesome coffee. Owned by Hamid Rafati, a successful Silicon Valley entrepreneur and run by a team of super nice and talented coffee peeps including Monica and Jason, Mazarine Coffee will serve Ritual and Klatch Coffee and offer both drip coffee, Espresso specialities prepared with a brand new Kees van der Westen Spirit (probably a very unique sight in this town) as well as great food and other drinks. If you happen to pass them in the next few days you should pop in to say hi. You’ll be one of their first ever customers!\n\n**The** next day I jumped on a local bus to visit Aquiles at Flywheel Coffee Roasters in Haight Ashbury. This legendary area of San Francisco has been home to many characters including Janis Joplin and Charles Manson. Located right next to the Whole Foods Market, Flywheel Coffee Roasters occupies a former bike shop and still retains many of its charming elements. Aquiles and his team focus on great quality coffee that he sources in small batches to ensure it never stays on the shelves longer than ten days. The huge open space is inviting and friendly and the coffee is excellent. I sipped on a mason jar of their cold brew for a good half hour while chatting with Aquiles about his family’s long history in coffee and his own ambition to create something unique for the neighbourhood.\n\nRead our review of [Flywheel Coffee Roasters…](https://thecoffeevine.com/reviews/cafes/usa/sanfrancisco/flywheel-coffee-roasters-san-francisco-us/)\n\n**After** leaving Flywheel Coffee Roasters I jumped back on the 71 bus to head as far West as I had ever been. My destination was Andytown Coffee Roasters, one of the city’s latest arrivals on the coffee scene and probably the furtherst away from the center. I took a short stroll through American suburbia to get to the small corner shop café on Lawton street. This part of town feels so far away from anything you might never even associate with San Fran if it wasn’t for the hills and slightly overcast weather. Lauren and Michael Crabbe, the husband and wife pair behind Andytown Coffee Roasters always wanted to create a homely place that seamlessly integrated into its surroundings. Headbarista and roaster Sandra took great care of me and suggested I try their “snowy plover” specialty drink, which consists of two shots of Espresso, Pellegrino soda water, ice and a dollop of whipped cream. Needless to say I rolled out of there happy and satisfied.\n\nRead our review of [Andytown Coffee Roasters…](https://thecoffeevine.com/reviews/cafes/usa/sanfrancisco/andytown-coffee-roasters-san-francisco-us/)\n\n***“Their commitment to excellent coffee is evident from the first moment and Hein said his buyers spend up to nine months a year traveling the world to seek out the finest coffees.”***\n\n**My** third day in San Francisco started off in my most favourite part of town, The Mission. Matthew Hein, owner of famous roasters Four Barrel was so kind to offer my two friends from Seattle and I a cupping and a little tour around their busy facilities. We couldn’t have wished for a better start into the day. Hein, a ball of energy who made us feel really at home showed us around the fantastic space that Four Barrel occupies, including a little viewing of the ancient Dutch four barrel roaster they still use to make test runs and we joined Taylor and a group of local students for a cupping next door. The set up at Four Barrel is really great. Two barristas operate two Slayers while another drip specialist freshly prepares slow coffee orders on the left side of the space. Their commitment to excellent coffee is evident from the first moment you walk in and Hein said his buyers spend up to nine months a year traveling the world to seek out the finest coffees. Nicaragua only just made its debut in their product pallette because until now they hadn’t found a single finca that could meet their processing standards. Exciting times over on Valencia Street!\n\nRead our review of [Four Barrel Coffee Roasters…](https://thecoffeevine.com/?p=7052)\n\n**Afterwards** we tucked into some delicious carnitas and burritos at Cancun, one of the area’s most famous Mexican joints and then spent a while overlooking San Francisco from Dolores park. If only we could have these views in Amsterdam!\n\n***“This [Sightglass’] incredible space on 7th Street literally blew me away!”***\n\n**Our** next stop on the list was Sightglass Coffee Roasters. These guys have also been around for a few years and recently opened their gorgeous second outlet on 21st Street. This smaller space is beautifully designed and decorated and the guys here were super kind. Especially after it turned out that Peter Smith, Sightglass’ Wholesale Buyer and I had miscommunicated on where we were actually supposed to meet. The peeps at 21st street helped me out to rearrange my appointment and jump into an Uber to be over at the main roastery on 7th street in a flash. This incredible space literally blew me away! A three floor barn like shop with a massive central bar and the huge roastery right at the front. Despite its size it still feels cozy and after finally shaking hands with Peter we sat down at the balcony upstairs from where I had a commanding view of the place. Sightglass, like Four Barrel, have significantly helped to put SF on the coffee map and like Four Barrel, their aim to be purveyors of only the best coffees. I tried their bombastic Owl’s Howl Espresso, which is also incredibly popular amongst their carefully selected partners and which I also got to enjoy as a cold brew in LA a few days later. More on that soon.\n\nRead our review of [Sightglass Coffee Roasters…](https://thecoffeevine.com/?p=7259)\n\n***“[…] Eileen Hassi Rinaldi and her dedicated team started roasting their own coffee on a Stumptown borrowed roaster back in 2006.”***\n\n**The** next morning, San Francisco had a bit of downer in store for us. A huge storm that began to pound the Bay Area over night had caused massive flooding in certain parts, cut power supply to my auberge and surrounding area and massively messed up the flight schedules at four major airports. After finally managing to sorting out my flights and deciding to re-book my trip to LA to the next day, I headed down to Valencia once again to check out the last must-see coffee spot on my list.\n\nRitual Coffee Roasters, like the previous two, have been around since 2005 and have done great things since Eileen Hassi Rinaldi and her dedicated team started roasting their own coffee on a Stumptown borrowed roaster back in 2006. Now they maintain a few shops around town, with the Valencia flag ship store being the most impressive. Reminicent of a space ship, the huge central bar features two Synesso Espresso machines and a beautiful drip bar, while the back offers a communal table where people can gather to chat and work. Due to my messy morning I had just missed Eileen but then jumped back on the BART to head to the hidden roastery closer to the center to meet with her and share a cuppa Joe. Also here, Ritual’s buyers invest a great amount of time and energy to visit coffee farmers and develop turly outstanding relationships with them to ensure that every year they get better and better coffees.\n\nRead our review of [Ritual Coffee Roasters…](https://thecoffeevine.com/?p=7581)\n\n***“I took a sneaky look to both my left and right and saw gaping mouths all around.”***\n\n**Later** that day I ventured back to my first point of call where Shawna, manager of Blue Bottle Mint Plaza, invited me to join the bar and watch brew master Felix prepare a Siphon. If you’ve never seen this done live, you are in for a real treat and these guys certainly know their stuff. I sat down in between an older lady sipping on her cup of coffee and a tourist from Portugal and all three of us were hypnotized by the fascination that is this unique coffee making device.\n\nFelix explained every step of the way to allow everyone to get a better understanding of their unique process. He used 25g of Blue Bottle’s Suke Quto, Ethiopia and added the freshly ground coffee to the risen near-boiling water. After 35 seconds he broke the crust and after 1:30m he removed the heat source and gently stirred the coffee in order to ensure all grounds are wet but there is no overextraction. Soon after the coffee re-entered the bottom chamber after passing through a cloth filter. I took a sneaky look to both my left and right and saw gaping mouths all around. The coffee we ended up tasting was mind boggling.\n\n**As** my fourth day in the foggy city came to an end I decided to kill off some of the excess caffeine in my blood by taking my friend Mat to the Mikkeler bar on Mason street and indulge in some of the city’s finest craft beers before stuffing our faces with some incredibly delicious Thai food at The Old Siam.\n\n**It** goes without saying that this high adrenaline but incredibly rewarding visit to California’s most beauiful city was a total success. The people I met and the wonderfully warm welcome I got everywhere made me feel more at home here than anywhere else before. And who knows, maybe we got something very special in store for 2015.

    "raw_content": "# Best Coffee in San Francisco: San Francisco Coffee Shop Roundup\n\nBy [Lindsay](https://frugalfrolicker.com/author/lindsay/ \"Posts by Lindsay\")  on     [California](https://frugalfrolicker.com/destinations/north-america/usa/california/) [USA](https://frugalfrolicker.com/destinations/north-america/usa/)\n\nThis post was last updated on 2021 April 17\n\nYou know the drill by now. Lindsay visits a new city –> Lindsay samples ALL THE COFFEE.\n\nUpon further reflection, I think I really need to organize my coffee crawls a bit better. I constantly find myself near-force feeding (drinking?) my over-caffeinated self cup after cup of delicious coffee because I CAN’T RESIST. And when I only have a few days in a city, that’s not nearly enough time to thoroughly investigate all of the so-called best coffee.\n\nSo I think I need to stagger my coffee intake. Maybe try one cafe in the morning, and one mid-afternoon? Surely this would work better than drinking 3 cups in succession, just because all the good coffee happens to be located right near where I am at a given moment. Yeah… I’ll work on it.\n\nClearly I had no such strategy when sampling the best coffee in San Francisco. Here are the coffee shops I visited while I was in town last month:\n\nTable of Contents\n\n[Toggle](#)\n\n## Blue Bottle\n\nEver since my first trip to San Francisco 5 years ago, I’d been lusting for this sensational chicory iced coffee that I enjoyed one time at the Ferry Building. I couldn’t remember the proper name of the drink, nor the cafe where I’d procured it, but it was unlike any other coffee I’d ever had before.\n\nFast forward a few years and now I’ve got it in my Brooklyn neighborhood! I put 2 and 2 together the first time I sampled [Blue Bottle](http://www.bluebottlecoffee.com/)‘s signature drink, the New Orleans cold brew, at their Williamsburg location:\n\n> Initially conceived as an alternative to the erratically composed and often disappointing iced latte, our New Orleans iced coffee is cold-brewed for 12 hours with roasted chicory and sweetened with organic cane sugar. The end result is a potent concentrate that we cut with organic whole milk. It’s sweet, creamy and, perhaps most importantly, consistently delicious.\n\nChicory? Check. A San Francisco-based roasting company? Check. I had unknowingly sampled Blue Bottle’s finest 5 years ago before it exploded with full force onto the coffee scene. Though Blue Bottle is old news to me, I couldn’t visit San Francisco and NOT stop by at least once for a New Orleans cold brew. Normally iced coffee is not my go-to, but this one is pretty special. I can confidently report that it tastes equally amazing on both coasts, as it should.\n\n**Recommended Drink:** New Orleans cold brew, or a pourover  \n **Location:** There are 7 locations and counting in SF!\n\n## Reveille\n\nHere’s my story of [Reveille](http://www.reveillecoffee.com/): I woke up one morning, Yelped ‘best coffee in San Francisco’, walked down a really steep hill, and happened upon this wedge-shaped coffee shop. I was instantly won over by the bright sunlight streaming through the windows on both sides of the cafe, and briefly daydreamed about how I’d come here on weekends if I were a local, maybe sit on a stool at the window with my laptop and do some blogging and people watching.\n\nThen I tried a cappuccino and thought SHUT THE FRONT DOOR. This could be my spot! Reveille has some of the best coffee in San Francisco and I’m not over it.\n\n**Recommended Drink:** Cappuccino  \n **Location:** 200 Columbus Ave\n\n## Sightglass Coffee\n\nI stumbled upon the [Sightglass Coffee](https://www.sightglasscoffee.com/) stand while walking behind the Ferry Building one afternoon. I in no way was in need of a caffeine fix, but you know – in the name of research, I felt obligated to try their pourover. It was solid, but not OMG-worthy. On second thought, maybe I should have gone for the Hooker’s Mocha?\n\n**Recommended Drink:** Pourover  \n **Location:** 270 Seventh Street (or they sometimes have a stand behind the Ferry Building)\n\n## Cafe Trieste\n\nI discovered this cafe on my inaugural trip to SF 5 years ago and was delighted to find it just as charming this time around. [Cafe Trieste](http://www.caffetrieste.com/index.htm) is an old school Italian cafe with AMAZING espresso drinks. Really – they are seriously strong and delicious. You won’t find any new-fangled brews or pretension here at this 58-year-old establishment.\n\nIn fact, you’re more likely to see small families and older folks hanging out here rather than the hipster faction of the population. It’s a great place to hole up for an afternoon, either reading, working, or listening to the live music or poetry readings. I could easily see myself logging an exorbitant number of hours in this atmospheric cafe if I lived in San Francisco.\n\n**Recommended Drink:** Cappuccino (or any espresso drink)  \n **Location:** 601 Vallejo St\n\n## Ritual\n\nI know [Ritual](http://www.ritualroasters.com/). I like Ritual. Some New York coffee shops brew and sell their beans, but I’d never before experienced Ritual in the flesh. I stopped by their Hayes Valley location, which was more akin to a fancy coffee trailer in a parking lot but no less awesome than their flagship store in the Mission. Definitely order one of the many pourovers they have on offer (it’s what they do best), then take your cup to the park across the street to enjoy in the sun. Best way to start your day, with some of the best coffee in San Francisco!\n\n**Recommended Drink:** Pourover  \n **Location:** 1026 Valencia St (+ a few other locations)\n\n## Coffee Bar\n\nWith such a generic name, I was slightly skeptical to venture into [Coffee Bar](http://www.coffeebarsf.com/). And true enough, it’s not the typical third wave artisanal coffee shop I seek out. But I saw past the mod decor, walked straight to the counter, and ordered a Havana Latte without hesitation. What is this, you ask? Well it’s a latte with sweetened condensed milk. DELIGHTFUL.\n\n**Recommended Drink:** Havana Latte  \n **Location:** 433 Kearny (+ 2 other locations)\n\n**Check out my other coffee shop round ups:** [Brooklyn](https://frugalfrolicker.com/north-brooklyn-coffee/) // [Montreal](https://frugalfrolicker.com/montreal-coffee-shops/) // [London](https://frugalfrolicker.com/london-coffee-shops/) // [Sydney](https://frugalfrolicker.com/sydney-coffee-shops/) // [Budapest](https://frugalfrolicker.com/best-coffee-in-budapest/)\n\n**Pin it!**\n\nTags: [California](https://frugalfrolicker.com/tag/california/)[coffee](https://frugalfrolicker.com/tag/coffee/)[San Francisco](https://frugalfrolicker.com/tag/san-francisco/)[USA](https://frugalfrolicker.com/tag/usa/)\n\nPrevious Article[4th of July in NYC // FLASHBACK FRIDAY](https://frugalfrolicker.com/4th-of-july-in-nyc/)\n\nNext Article [Mauna Kea, Hawaii // FLASHBACK FRIDAY](https://frugalfrolicker.com/mauna-kea-hawaii/)\n\n### Related Stories\n\n* ### [2024 in Review: I Finally Unpacked All My Suitcases](https://frugalfrolicker.com/2024-review/)\n* ### [2023 in Review: Around The World & Back Again](https://frugalfrolicker.com/2023-review/)\n* ### [The 7 Best Southern California Day Trips From Anaheim](https://frugalfrolicker.com/day-trips-from-anaheim-california/)\n\n "
